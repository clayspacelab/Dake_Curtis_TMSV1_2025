# Dake_Curtis_TMSV1_2025

#### This is a repository for Dake M., Curtis C. E. (2025). Perturbing human V1 degrades the fidelity of visual working memory. [Nature Communications](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.19.599798v1).
#### Accompanying data associated with this project is available on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/hf5a4)

#### The repository provides:
##### 1. Python code to generate estimates of E-field based on SimNIBS simulations in participants' native spaces. The Efield estimates in V1 are provided as a csv file to reproduce Figure 1C.
##### 2. Python code to estimate behavioral performance estimates by conditions for Experiments 1 and 2: saccade error (Figure 2A), reaction time (Supplementary Figure 2A) and saccade velocity (Supplementary Figure 2B).
##### 3. Python code to estimate behavioral performance estiamtes on control experiment (Experiment 3) (Supplementary Figure 4B).
##### 4. MATLAB code to produce topoplot for alpha-band activity corresponding for No TMS and TMS in Experiment 1 (Figure 2B).

#### The original repository contains additional codes for experimental design, running segmentation, E-field simulations, preprocessing of EEG and eyetracking data as well as analyzing behavioral and neural data as used in the paper. [Github Link](https://github.com/mindemory/mgs_stimul)

#### Any additional data not provided on osf, can be made available upon additional request to the authors.
